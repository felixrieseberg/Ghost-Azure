# Triangle Ghost Theme #

The Triangle Ghost theme is built as a solid foundation for any project. This theme can serve as a starting point for advanced web developers, while also providing a clean design for those who prefer to grow their style organically over time. We have released this theme under Creative Commons license and only ask that you retain the links to Ghost and Haeck Design for our efforts.

### Customization ###

There are 4 basic steps to making this theme your own...

1. **Install your theme.**  Unzip your package and drop it in your theme folder. Enable it on the "General" settings page.

2. **Edit the social media links.**  The social media icons included in this theme currently point to nowhere - So lets fix that!! Include the link you want to use into the href field. You should also adjust the link title to appropriately describe where the link is going. Using an empty block is not ideal, but until HTML5 rules on the concept we will be using that to create icons. Be sure to remove any links you're not using since they contain schema information about your website. The class of the object depends on where it's being used, but this is what a icon link to our Twitter page would look like...

3. **Select your font & style.**  Adjust the colors & textures to your liking, edit the favicon & apple touch icons, find a nice header image and youre all good. If you want to change Google fonts, just change this code in the header of default.hbs and adjust your css accordingly (look for the "Montserrat" references in custom.css & uikit.css. 

4. **Fill in Menu Items.**  Start simple, then expand. These items will appear in your navigation and the dropdown that appears on mobile devices (shrink your screen width to see).
